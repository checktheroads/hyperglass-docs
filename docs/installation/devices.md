`devices.toml` is structured as three separate dictionaries for devices, credentials, and proxies. All values are strings.

#### Example

```toml
[router.'pop1']
address = "192.0.2.1"
asn = "65000"
src_addr_ipv4 = "192.0.2.251"
src_addr_ipv6 = "2001:db8::1"
credential = "default"
location = "pop1"
name = "router1.pop1"
display_name = "Washington, DC"
port = "22"
type = "cisco_ios"
proxy = "jumpbox1"

[router.'pop2']
address = "192.0.2.2"
asn = "65000"
src_addr_ipv4 = "192.0.2.252"
src_addr_ipv6 = "2001:db8::2"
credential = "frr_api_pop2"
location = "pop2"
name = "router1.pop2"
display_name = "Portland, OR"
port = "8080"
type = "frr"
proxy = ""
```

## Credentials

The credential table stores the username and password for a device. SSH Key authentication is not yet supported. If using FRRouting and the [hyperglass-frr](https://github.com/checktheroads/hyperglass-frr) API, the username can be any arbitrary value (it is not used), and the password is the PBKDF2 SHA256 _hashed_ API key (**not** the API key itself).

#### Example

```toml
[credential.'default']
username = "hyperglass"
password = "secret_password"

[credential.'frr_api_pop2']
username = "doesntmatter"
password = "$pbkdf2-sha256$29000$bI0xJqQUQoixtjZGSAnhvA$FM0oUc.Y3kuvl9ilQmMuULTD1MjzD64Ax9rFNUgAl.c"
```

!!! warning "Security Warning"
    These values are stored in plain text, so make sure the accounts are restricted. Instructions for creating restricted accounts on common platforms can be found [here](../../extras/securing-router-access).

## Proxies

The proxy table stores the connection parameters for an SSH proxy.

When a proxy server is defined in the `[router]` table, the defined proxy name is matched to a configured proxy as shown above. When the connection to the device is initiated, the hyperglass server will first initiate an SSH connection to the proxy, and then initiate a second connection to the target device (router) _from_ the proxy server. This can be helpful if you want to secure access to your routers.

| **ssh_command** | Command used to initiate an SSH connection _from_ the proxy server to the target device. `{username}` will map to the target device (router) username as defined in its associated credential mapping. `{host}` will map to the target device IP address as defined in `devices.toml`. |

#### Example

```toml
[proxy.'jumpbox1']
address = "10.1.1.1"
username = "hyperglass"
password = "secret_password"
type = "linux_ssh"
ssh_command = "ssh -l {username} {host}"

[proxy.'jumpbox2']
address = "10.1.1.2"
username = "hyperglass"
password = "secret_password"
type = "linux_ssh"
ssh_command = "ssh -l {username} {host}"
```

!!! note "Compatibility"
    hyperglass has only been tested with `linux_ssh` as of this writing.
